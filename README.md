# TitleDB++
**a TitleDB.com frontend**

This is my first project that uses AngularJS (and also my first time using GitHub). It is mostly a playground to experiment with said things and aims to probably provide a nice frontend to http://titledb.com as a by-product.

Here's a small todo-list:

- Add proper user agent string to API requests to TitleDB
- ~~QR-Code output~~ wew lad
- ~~Fix phone layout~~
- ~~Fix behavior of cards when one card is longer than others~~ *kinda fixed*
- ~~Filtering / Searching~~
- Display title count
- Display a "last update" date as soon as the API provides it
- Sorting
- Submission of titles to TitleDB.com
- ~~Better QR display~~
- Better QR animation
- Other views, i.e. list view?

Also planned:
- Display the source (show where TitleDB sources the CIA from, i.e. GitHub, Dropbox)
- Link GitHub repos if sourced from there
- Try to incorporate descriptions from the GitHub README.MD
