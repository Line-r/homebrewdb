# TitleDB++
**a TitleDB.com frontend**

This is my first project that uses AngularJS (and also my first time using GitHub). It is mostly a playground to experiment with said things and aims to probably provide a nice frontend to http://titledb.com as a by-product.

Here's a small todo-list:

- Add proper user agent string to API requests to TitleDB
- QR-Code output
